          Hooray! It's snowing! It's time to make a snowman.James runs out. He
          makes a big pile of snow. He puts a big snowball on top. He adds a
          scarf and a hat. He adds an orange for the nose. He adds coal for the
          eyes and buttons.In the evening, James opens the door. What does he
          see? The snowman is moving! James invites him in. The snowman has
          never been inside a house. He says hello to the cat. He plays with
          paper towels.A moment later, the snowman takes James's hand and goes
          out.They go up, up, up into the air! They are flying! What a wonderful
          night!The next morning, James jumps out of bed. He runs to the door.He
          wants to thank the snowman. But he's gone.
